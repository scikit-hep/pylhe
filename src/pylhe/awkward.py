    Uses Awkward's ArrayBuilder to construct the array by iterating over the events.
    The events_iterable should yield instances of LHEEvent.
    This is typically created by one of the reading functions pylhe provides like
    pylhe.read_lhe(filepath), pylhe.read_lhe_with_attributes(filepath), or pylhe.read_lhe_file(filepath).events.
