# Summary
<!-- APN TODO: check that all references in paper.bib are cited in the text -->
Some history/introduction history of different formats. HEPEVT -> LHEF -> HepMC -> HDF5? (since its binary maybe in the future? Unlike hepmc/lhe no need to gzip!)

The format is used by major Monte Carlo event generators such as MadGraph, POWHEG, Sherpa, HERWIG, Pythia ... <!-- APN TODO add references here-->
...

Format is XML-like where the free text is designed to be easily parsed in fortran <!-- APN TODO: copy example form jupyter notebook 00_*.ipynb -->

```xml
```
