# Summary

Historically, one of the first standards for event representation in high-energy physics were the HEPEVT and HEPRUP common blocks [@Boos:2001cv], which provided a Fortran-based structure for storing event information.
As the complexity of simulations increased, the need for a more flexible and extensible format led to the development of the Les Houches Event (LHE) file format [@Alwall:2006yp].
LHE introduced an XML structure that allowed for better organization of event data and facilitated interoperability between different Monte Carlo event generators.
Typically, LHE files are used to describe parton-level events generated by matrix element generators before they are passed to parton shower and hadronization programs producing HepMC files [@Dobbs:2001ck;@Verbytskyi:2020sus;@hans_dembinski_2022_7013498].
In contrast to LHE files HepMC stores fewer details about the particles, but also contain many more particles.
Both files are plain text-based formats, making them human-readable but potentially large.
Hence, compression using gzip is common practice for both formats.
In the future a binary format such as HDF5 [@hdf5] could be considered for event storage to improve read/write performance and reduce file sizes further.

The LHE format uses an XML-like structure, but the content within the `<init>` and `<event>` blocks consists of whitespace-separated values designed for straightforward parsing in Fortran.
The `<header>` block can contain arbitrary XML content, usually metadata or comments explaining how the events were generated.
In below skeleton example we illustrate the overall structure of an LHE file using the `pylhe` naming of the attributes

```xml
<LesHouchesEvents version="1.0">
<header></header>
<init>
beamA beamB energyA energyB PDFgroupA PDFgroupB PDFsetA PDFsetB weightingStrategy numProcesses
xSection error unitWeight procId
...
# additional hash-commented information can go here
</init>
<event>
nparticles pid weight scale aqed aqcd
id status mother1 mother2 color1 color2 px py pz e m lifetime spin
...
# additional hash-commented information can go here
</event>
...
</LesHouchesEvents>
```

Below we give a table summarizing the main parameters found in LHE files grouped by their `dataclass` representation in `pylhe`.

Further details can be found in the original definition of the Les Houches Event file standard in [@Alwall:2006yp].
Besides the original publication there were two extensions to the LHE format, version 2.0 in 2009 [@Butterworth:2010ym] and version 3.0 in 2012 [@Andersen:2014efa].
However, `pylhe` currently only implements the only widely adopted extension from version 1.0, that is the addition of multiple weights via `<initrwgt>`, `<rwgt>`, `<weight>`,`<weights>`, `<wgt>`, and `<weightgroup>`.
If in the future there is a demand for `<scales>`, `<generator>`, `<pdfinfo>`, or `<clustering>` support these can be added as well.

# Statement of need

The format is used by all major Monte Carlo event generators such as MadGraph [@Alwall:2014hca], POWHEG-BOX [@Nason:2004rx;@Frixione:2007vw;@Alioli:2010xd], Sherpa [@Gleisberg:2008ta;@Sherpa:2019gpd], HERWIG [@Corcella:2000bw;@Bahr:2008pv;@Bellm:2015jjp;@Bellm:2019zci;@Bewick:2023tfi], Pythia [@Sjostrand:2006za;@Sjostrand:2007gs;@Sjostrand:2014zea;@Bierlich:2022pfr], Whizard [@Kilian:2007gr;@Moretti:2001zz].
They produce hard scattering events in the LHE format which are then passed to parton shower and hadronization programs or directly to analysis frameworks.
While interfaces for C/C++/Fortran exist in the respective generators, a lightweight and easy-to-use Python interface was missing until the inception of `pylhe` in 2015.

`pylhe` allows for easy reading and writing of `.lhe` and `.lhe.gz` files in Python, enabling seamless integration into modern pythonic data analysis workflows in high-energy physics.
The pythonic yielding generator approach allows for memory-efficient processing of very large LHE files by streaming events one at a time rather than loading entire files into memory.
The library facilitates quick validation of event files through programmatic access to event structure and particle properties, making it straightforward to perform sanity checks on generated events.
This can be done for example via the integration with Awkward Array [@Pivarski_Awkward_Array_2018] through the `to_awkward()` function, which converts LHE events into columnar data structures optimized for vectorized operations and efficient analysis of large datasets.
Additionally, `pylhe` serves as a crucial interface for emerging machine learning applications in particle physics, allowing researchers to efficiently extract and preprocess event data for training neural networks and other ML models used in event classification, anomaly detection, and physics analysis.

## Impact

`pylhe` has already been used in various research projects and publications within high-energy physics.
It has been cited in Higgs studies [@Brehmer:2019gmn;@Stylianou:2023tgg;@Feuerstake:2024uxs], SUSY / BSM / dark matter searches [@Beresford:2018pbt;@Kling:2020iar;@Anisha:2023xmh;@Zhou:2022jgj;@Zhou:2024fjf;@Cheung:2024oxh;@Beresford:2024dsc], forward physics [@Kling:2022ykt;@Kelly:2021mcd;@Kling:2020mch], but also in methodological studies involving machine learning techniques for event generation and analysis [@Brehmer:2019xox;@Kofler:2024efb].
